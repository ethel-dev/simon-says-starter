# simon-says-starter

This is starter code created for a class I am teaching on basic game programming in JavaScript for non-profit organization Fidgetech in the Portland metro area in Oregon, USA. It is a 3x3 Simon style game written in asynchronous JavaScript. It's designed to teach about basic game programming concepts for someone just getting into making games with modern JavaScript.

This project utilizes async functions with await, LocalStorage, modern CSS3 rules, simple data structures, flexbox etc. There's a lot of complexity hiding in JavaScript and modern web development, and I am hoping to be able to break it down to show some modern usage while also introducing the language.
